# ðŸ§¨ Attack Panel â€“ Hybrid Network Defense Lab

This branch introduces the **Attack Panel**, a set of simulated offensive tools and scripts used to generate malicious traffic in a controlled lab environment. These attacks are designed to test detection and response capabilities of IDS/IPS tools like **Zeek**, **Suricata**, and **Wazuh**.

## ðŸš© Purpose

The attack panel simulates common attacker behavior including:
- SSH brute-force attempts
- Network scanning and enumeration
- DNS tunneling
- Malicious file delivery

These scenarios help validate that your **defensive tools** are logging and alerting correctly, and allow you to **test incident response workflows**.


## Visuals

SSH Brute Force using Hydra

DNS Tunneling 
-Use Kali to connect to tunnel

-Use Vic VM to create Tunnel and establish connection
