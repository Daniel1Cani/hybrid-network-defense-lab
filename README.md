# 🧨 Attack Panel – Hybrid Network Defense Lab

This branch introduces the **Attack Panel**, a set of simulated offensive tools and scripts used to generate malicious traffic in a controlled lab environment. These attacks are designed to test detection and response capabilities of IDS/IPS tools like **Zeek**, **Suricata**, and **Wazuh**.

## 🚩 Purpose

The attack panel simulates common attacker behavior including:
- SSH brute-force attempts
- Network scanning and enumeration
- DNS tunneling
- Malicious file delivery

These scenarios help validate that your **defensive tools** are logging and alerting correctly, and allow you to **test incident response workflows**.
